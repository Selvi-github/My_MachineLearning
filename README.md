## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Selvi-github/My_MachineLearning.git
   cd My_MachineLearning
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux / Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üí° Usage

- Open Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

- Run scripts from the `src/` folder to train and evaluate models:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py --config config.yaml
   ```

- Check outputs in the `results/` folder.

## üß© Configuration

If `config.yaml` or `.json` files are included, they can be used to set:
- Dataset paths
- Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs
- Model parameters

## üìä Evaluation & Metrics

Typical evaluation includes:
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Visuals: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Training Curves
